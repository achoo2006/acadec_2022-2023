Early American literature was typically economic, religious, or political works.
The word "literature" has changed throughout the years - previously referring to any writing, but now more widely defined as aesthetic literature (belles lettres). Much of early american literature was pragmatic, however.
Many countires criticized America's lack of culture
	Sydney Smith once proclaimed "In the four quarters of the globe, who reads an American book?"

Early American literature had a slow development, since book manufacturing was expensive, so often times already celebrated writers would be printed instead of fresh American authors.
In addition, many works were difficult to culturally distinguish from that of Great Britains. 
Eventually, when America had to develop it's own culture, many American authors would try to avoid imitating British authors. In addition, they felt that they had insufficient material to work with (no long history).
One of the first widely acclaimed (and financially successful) books was *[[The Sketch Book]]*, which was authored in the United States. However, it still struggled with the cultural divide, being set in Great Britain.

Many American authors would use Indian culture as a basis for their work, however, the government was actively attempting to remove Indians from their land. So the portrayal of Indians were split in twain - on one hand dangerous savages, on the other romanticized as stoic, courageous, and eloquent inhabitants.
	While the second description seems to be largely positive, it is a reflection of the common belief that American Indians were less civilized than Europeans (i.e. "noble savages").
