Irving traveled many times to Europe on account of it's "superior aesthetic resources."
	"Europe held forth all the charms of storied and poetical association. There were to be seen the masterpieces of art, the refinements of highly cultivated society, the quaint peculiarities of ancient and local custom. . . . I will visit this land of wonders . . .and see the gigantic race from which I am degenerated."
One of the first widely acclaimed (and financiall successful) books authored in the U.S.
Mostly set in Great Britain, still unable to get past the cultural intwinement
Still includes some tales set in North America, notably "Rip Van Winkle," "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow," "The Traits of Indian Character," and "Philip of Pokanoket: An Indian Memoir."
