American Exceptionalism pops up, transcending time the boundaries of time itself!  (ok maybe not that exciting)
American Exceptionalism is a belief that Americans were unique or exceptional. 
This affected literature, pointing several authors to present America as an ideal place of democracy and freedom. This is especially obvious in Early American literature, where many canonical works were what they were because of their focus on this idea, like [[Common Sense]] and [[Autobiography (Benjamin Franklin)]].
