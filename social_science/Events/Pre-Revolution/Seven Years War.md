aliases: [French and Indian War]

Beginning in 1756, the outcome of the Seven Years War played a significant role in the [[Colonists (British)|colonists]] decision to revolt against the crown.

The Seven Years War was a conflict mainly between the [[French]] and [[British]], but many [[Indians|Indian]] tribes were brought into the fighting.

**Cause**
	The war mainly stemmed from a long standing sort-of general dislike between the [[French]] and [[British]].
	The first few wars between them in the colonies stemmed from existing disputes from the European continent. The Seven Years War is special in that it stemmed from territorial issues in North America.
	In short, some fur traders in Pennsylvania wanted to strade with some [[Indians]] in the Ohio River Valley.
	Virginia bought 200,000 acres of land in the Ohio River Valley for the trade deal
	[[French|France]] looked at that and thought "hey wait, but that's ours!" and began building up forts along the Alleghany River.

**The [[Albany Congress]] (June 19 to July 11, 1754.)**
	Organized an alliance with the [[Iroquois]] Confederacy
	Thought of methods to defend [[French]]-controlled Canada

**War Breaks Out**
	While the [[Albany Congress]] was ongoing, fighting would break out
	Robert Dinwiddie, the virginiana governer at the time, sent George Washington to force out the [[French]].
		The [[French]] said "nah don't feel like it"
		Washington went home
	The [[British]] wouldn't take no for an answer, though, and Washington quickly returned with a small force
		This small force would attack a small scouting party, an initial success
		However, the [[French]] would retaliate and capture Washington at Force Necessity

**The Seven Years War**
	As a global conflict, the Seven Years' War would open many fronts across the planet
		Notable examples being North America, the Carribean, Europe, South America, India, and the Pacific Ocean
	Spain would participate minimally in the North [[Colonists (British)|American]] continent, though did not play a significant role in the war.
	The Algonquian group would fight on the side of the [[French]], leading attacks along the [[British]] frontier
	The [[British]] suffered defeat after defeat in the first four years, losing Fort Oswego and Fort William henry.
	The British began to gain the upper hand in the North American conflict after William Pitt took charge
		He believed that North America was crucial for Britain to achieve WORLD DOMINATION!!!!
		Pitt would expend greaters efforts in North America, taking Louisbourg, Canada, and a port at the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River (1758).

**Aftermath**
	This be concluded by the Treaty of Paris
