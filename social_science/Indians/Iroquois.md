Originally the five nations:
	[[Mohawk]]
	[[Oneida]]
	[[Onondaga]]
	[[Cayuga]]
	[[Seneca]]

Often had conflicts with the [[Algonquians]] and Seneca groups

Would later be joined by the Tuscarora, making them the Six Nations.

Geography
	The Iroquois geography played a key role in helping them deal with Europeans
	For one, they were far away from the coast, allowing them time to observe European intentions without necessarily dealing with them
	They were also right in the center of Dutch, [[French]] and [[British]] land claims, allowing them to strategically pit rival settlers against each other.
