aliases: [Indian, Native American]

Fun Fact: Indians generally do not like the term Native American. The reason is "overinclusivity." America spans two huge continents, with many indiginous civilizations in between, all with unique cultures. Native American is a broad enough term such that their use of it makes it almost impossible to really identify with the word. so im just going to call them indians (plus it's shorter).
