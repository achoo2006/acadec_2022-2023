aliases: [Indian, Native American]

Fun Fact: Indians generally do not like the term Native American. The reason is "overinclusivity." America spans two huge continents, with many indiginous civilizations in between, all with unique cultures. Native American is a broad enough term such that their use of it makes it almost impossible to really identify with the word. so im just going to call them indians (plus it's shorter).

Initially, the Indians welcomed trade.
	Practical items
		 Ex: woven cloth, metal kettles, iron axes, fishhooks, and guns
		 Quickly integrated into Native customs, transforming cooking, agriculture, hunting, and domestic practices.
	Ornamental items
		Ex: glass beads and copper ornaments
		Mostly for religion
Consequences
	European military superiority gave European traders the advantage in negotiations.
	More reliance on European products forced the Natives to hunt more animals.
		This would strain the relationships between Native tribes.
