The [[British]] and the French were the main European powers in the New World by the mid-eighteenth century.
New France claimed an expanse of territory from Newfoundland, across the Great Lakes to the Ohio River Valley, followed the Mississippi River south, and stretched as far west as the Rocky Mountains, possessing significantly more land than the British

Population
	By the start of the [[Seven Years War]], the [[British]] population consisted of nearly 2 million individuals, while the French only had about 65,000 inhabitants.
	Their population was mainly Catholic, leading to hostilities with the neighboring French settlers.

French Relations with Natives:
	Often motivated by:
	Glory
	Profit
		The importance of the fur trade led to many familial ties being made between the French and natives.
	Religion
		Many French settlers believed in converting the "savages" to Christianity.
		Father Paul le Jeune published _[[The Jesuit Relations]]_
	As a result of their motivations, engagements were both long and frequent.
