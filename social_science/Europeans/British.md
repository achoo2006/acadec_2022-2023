[[Colonists (British)|American]] 

While the [[French]] were more willing to interact with the [[Indians]], British colonial policy was generally "yo this is our land now, get off."
	Because of this attitude towards the [[Indians]], they had few intermarriages and even fewer missionaries. This shows that their motivations leaned towards profit and glory, as opposed to religion.
	They had believed that the [[Indians]] were not improving the land, and so had no claim to it.
	Many officials would try to buy land, usually forcing the [[Indians]] to accept by defeating them militarily.
		They would make "attempts" to prevent settling of unclaimed [[Indians|Indian]] land. However, it was poorly enforced and usually [[Indians]] would be displaced regardless.

Colonial Identity:
	The colonial identity was extremely diverse.
		Michel-Guillaume Jean de Crèvecoeur: “What then is the [[Colonists (British)|American]], this new man?”
	Primarily made up of 3 types of people:
		Settlers
			Less than two thirds of the population (1770)
		Slaves
			Around one fifth of the population (1770)
		[[Indians]]
	Anglicization
		Stemmed from a shared sense of "British identity"
			Many [[Colonists (British)|colonists]] often attempted to mimic the British way of life
			This meant drinking tea
			Wearing imported clothing
