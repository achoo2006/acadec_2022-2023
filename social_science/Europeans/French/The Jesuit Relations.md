Detailed efforts by le Jeune to convert the [[Indians]] in New [[French|France]] to Christianity

The Jesuit Relations, also known as Relations des JÃ©suites de la Nouvelle-[[French|France]], are chronicles of the Jesuit missions in New [[French|France]]. The works were written annually and printed beginning in 1632 and ending in 1673.

"As to the mind of the Savage, it is of good quality. I believe that souls are all made from the same stock ,and that they do not materially differ."
This shows that he admired the [[Indians|Indian]]'s physical strength, intelligence, contentment, and diplomacy.

However, he also criticized them for being arrogant, proud, vindicitive, and lacking in compassion. This is one good example of the [[French]] belief that converting the [[Indians]] was necessary.
